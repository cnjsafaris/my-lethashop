## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Push to Git Repository

git add .
git commit -m "Configure project for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose your repository
4. Netlify will auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`
5. Click "Deploy site"

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
After deployment, add these in Netlify dashboard:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app
```

### 4. Test Your Deployment
- ✅ Homepage loads correctly
- ✅ Products page displays items
- ✅ Individual product pages work
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Navigation functions properly

## 📝 Important Notes

### Database Considerations
- Current setup uses in-memory data (development)
- For production, consider setting up:
  - PostgreSQL on Heroku/Supabase
  - MongoDB Atlas
  - MySQL on PlanetScale

### Authentication
- Mocha auth service needs proper environment variables
- Update CORS settings if using custom domain

### Performance
- Build generates optimized bundles
- Asset caching configured via netlify.toml
- Gzip compression enabled
